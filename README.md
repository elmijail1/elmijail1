## Hi, I'm MijaÃ­l ðŸ‘‹

I've been studying frontend web dev and trying to make useful & accessible web apps for about 1.5 years. In my projects I currently stick to React JS (functional) but lately I've given a try to TypeScript and found it quite enjoyable too!

At the moment I have only 1 project that truly meets my standards and is thus available to public: [Georgian Transliterator](https://github.com/elmijail1/georgian-transliterator). I've been working on several more apps recently and they all are language-related since linguistics is my area of interest (not the only one though).

I would be really excited to test my skills & knowledge in a project with a team of experienced developers. It would be great to learn from them and start my own career in a company of professionals who help their teammates grow. I have experience with React JS, React Router, and Vitest. I also have basic understanding of React Query, TypeScript, node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. If you're hiring, let's chat!
