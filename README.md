## Hi, I'm Mikhail 👋

I've been studying web dev and building small apps for about 2 years. My latest project is full-stack, built with Next.js and TypeScript – the stack I plan to keep honing in future projects.

## 🧳 Projects
I've completed two projects so far:
1. [Georgian Transliterator](https://github.com/elmijail1/georgian-transliterator)
2. [Profile Practice](https://github.com/elmijail1/profile-practice-nextjs)

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools

Currently working with:
- Next.js 15
- TypeScript
- Prisma 6
- Next Auth 4
- React 19
- Cursor
  
Also have experience with:
- React Router
- Firebase
- Vitest

## 🎯 Goals
I'm excited to test my skills in a project with a team of experienced developers. I'm eager to learn from others and grow in a team that values collaboration and mentorship.

## 🧠 What I want to learn
- **SWR**: used it in my *Profile Practice* app, want to deepen my understanding
- **Payment Solutions**: how do you design a smooth payment experience?
- **Accessibility**: I've neglected it for too long, time to fix that
- **Testing**: I've already had experience with Vitest, but I certainly need more of it
- **CI/CD**: I have a very vague idea of what it is, should fix that
- **Edtech Stacks**: what are modern educational web apps made of?

## 🏛 What I want to build
### 1. Average Blood Pressure web app 🩸
_A simple health tracker where users can log and visualize their typical blood pressure ranges._
- **Possible stack**: Next.js, Prisma, NextAuth
- **Learning opportunities**: accessibility, testing

### 2. Newts of the World online store 🦎
_Inspired by Karel Čapek's "War with the Newts": a fictional ecommerce store selling giant newts._
- **Possible stack**: Next.js, Prisma, NextAuth
- **Learning opportunities**: ecommerce layout, payment systems
