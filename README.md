## Hi, I'm Mikhail ðŸ‘‹

I've been studying web dev and building small apps for about 2 years. My latest project is full-stack and built with Next.js and TypeScript â€“ and that's the stack core I'm planning to hone in my further projects.

At the moment I have 2 finished projects:
1. [Georgian Transliterator](https://github.com/elmijail1/georgian-transliterator)
2. [Profile Practice](https://github.com/elmijail1/profile-practice-nextjs)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Tools
Currently working with:
- Next.js 15
- Next Auth 4
- Prisma 6
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Cursor
  
I also have experience with:
- React Router
- Firebase
- Vitest

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
I'm excited to test my skills in a project with a team of experienced developers. I'm eager to learn from others and grow in a team that values collaboration and mentorship.
